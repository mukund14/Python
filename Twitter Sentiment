Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Here, we apply Sentiment Analysis to Tweets. The Data will be collected from Twitter pages of the non-profit organizations and will be stored in a list. Let's use the natural language processing toolkit. It is very useful in language processing or text analytics.
In [1]:
from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier
Since we want to classify a text into sentiments, the Naive Bayes Classifier will be used. The reasons for choosing this being:
Classifier takes less time to build and compute
Has efficient performance with multi-class classification.
Does not need a lot of training data
Less likely to overfit with smaller sample size
Works best with independent attributes but has no problem with non-independent attributes.
Importing other relevant libraries from NLTK.
In [2]:
from nltk.corpus import subjectivity #From the NLTK corpus we will import subjectivity to classify a tweet as subjective/objective.
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentAnalyzer #SentimentAnalyzer Library to perform the library
from nltk.sentiment.util import *
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer #Sentiment and Intensity Analyzer will perform our required analysis
Preparing & Exploring the Data
The NLTK corpus has 10,000 instances. So, we will split it into two, one with subjective instances and other with objective instances. (subj_docs, obj_docs)
In [3]:
n_instances = 10000
subj_docs = [(sent, 'subj') for sent in subjectivity.sents(categories='subj')[:n_instances]]
obj_docs = [(sent, 'obj') for sent in subjectivity.sents(categories='obj')[:n_instances]]
len(subj_docs), len(obj_docs)
Out[3]:
(5000, 5000)
Let's explore the above created tuples (subj_docs, obj_docs) individually
In [4]:
obj_docs[1] #This will show that the element is an objective sentence
Out[4]:
([u'emerging',
  u'from',
  u'the',
  u'human',
  u'psyche',
  u'and',

  u'characteristics',

In [5]:

  u'enough',
  u'science',
  u'to',
  u'send',
  u'you',
  u'home',
  u'thinking',
  u'.'],
 'subj')
Data Modeling
We will build a training and testing model for the subjective and objective documents.Standard train and test split is 80:20. We will first build a training and test tuple and at a later stage apply Sentiment Analyzer method to it during the stage when we build the model.
In [51]:
train_subj_docs = subj_docs[:160] 
test_subj_docs = subj_docs[160:200] 
train_obj_docs = obj_docs[:160]
test_obj_docs = obj_docs[160:200]
training_docs = train_subj_docs+train_obj_docs
testing_docs = test_subj_docs+test_obj_docs
Now, we will store Sentiment Analyzer method in a variable which we use for all future purposes for calling as required
In [52]:
sentim_analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
We will clean this data to get rid of all negative words. Since Naive Bayes works well with independent features, we treat every word as a feature and naive bayes will analyze it separately. With the mark_negation method, we will enable the sentiment_analyzer to append _NEG suffix to words that appear in the scope between a negation in a sentence and a punctuation mark.
In [112]:
all_words_neg = sentim_analyzer.all_words([mark_negation(doc,shallow=True) for doc in training_docs]) 
#all_words returns all words in documents including duplicates.

unigram_feats = sentim_analyzer.unigram_word_feats(all_words_neg, top_n=160, min_freq=4) 
# We will analyze the sentiment of top 160 words which occur frequently and independently with unigram_word_feats method.

len(unigram_feats)
Out[112]:
160
In [113]:
sentim_analyzer.add_feat_extractor(extract_unigram_feats, unigrams=unigram_feats) 
#We want to extract the features of each unigram and apply sentiment analysis to it.
Building the Naive Bayes Classifier on the trained model
With the train and test data prepared, we can now start building our model. We will apply the sentiment analysis function to each of these tuples. Since, we want to apply Naive Bayes prediction technique to the training model, we will initialize another variable which will be trained in Naive Bayes. Then the classifier will be built.
In [114]:
training_set = sentim_analyzer.apply_features(training_docs)
trainer = NaiveBayesClassifier.train
classifier = sentim_analyzer.train(trainer, training_set)
Training classifier
Before we test Naive Bayes on our test dataset, we would have to first prepare the test data, in the form like the training data, i.e. with the features of the Sentiment Analyzer applied to it.
In [115]:
test_set = sentim_analyzer.apply_features(testing_docs)
print (nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier,test_set)) #Testing the accuracy of this model
0.7875
Let's study this accuracy in detail by evaluating how the Naive Bayes Classifier performed by looking at its Precision,Accuracy and F-measure
In [116]:
for key,value in sorted(sentim_analyzer.evaluate(test_set).items()):
        print('{0}: {1}'.format(key, value))
        
Evaluating NaiveBayesClassifier results...
Accuracy: 0.7875
F-measure [obj]: 0.784810126582
F-measure [subj]: 0.79012345679
Precision [obj]: 0.794871794872
Precision [subj]: 0.780487804878
Recall [obj]: 0.775
Recall [subj]: 0.8
Preparing New Test Data
We have seen how our model has been performing on test data. We will now test it on newer test data, which isn't available on the corpus and has been taken from the Twitter Page of the Non-Profit Organization. We first initialize a list which will contain a list of these tweets as given below.
In [117]:
sentences = [
    
    "disgusting",
